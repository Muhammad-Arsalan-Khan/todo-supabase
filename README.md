## Supabase Issue: Project Paused
Please note, the project is currently **paused** due to inactivity for over 90 days. As a result, the project and data are not accessible through the Supabase dashboard, but the **data is still intact** and can be restored from a backup.

### Reason for Pause
Supabase automatically pauses projects that remain inactive for **90 days** or more. If you wish to restore the project, you will need to:
1. Download the backups of the project data.
2. Restore the backup to a **new Supabase project**.
